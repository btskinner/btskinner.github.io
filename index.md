I am a data scientist for the National Endowment for the Humanities in the
Office of Data and Evaluation. In my role I support the internal work of the
agency and evaluations of its impact on the humanities across the nation via
data dashboards, visualizations, and research projects.

Prior to my position with the NEH, I was an assistant professor of higher
education and policy at the University of Florida and a research assistant
professor of education and policy at the University of Virginia. My research
interests centered on college access, the outcomes of college participation,
and using tools of data science such as machine learning and Bayesian statistics
to critically examine higher education policy questions that are difficult to
answer with conventional econometric tools.

In my work I have examined how students weigh factors like [distance and
cost](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11162-018-9507-1) when choosing
a college and the effect of college participation on both [economic
outcomes](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775715300303)
and [civic](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00221546.2017.1291258)
[behaviors](https://www.btskinner.io/repository/skinner2021civicii.pdf). I have
also used poststratification techniques to improve the representativeness of
survey responses among [former students who exited
early](https://doi.org/10.1177/23328584211065724) and to produce state-level
estimates of [low-income college
enrollment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775724000025)
using non-representative data. I have a particular interest in students' access
to broadband: how it varies across [student
populations](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11162-024-09775-w), its
connection to [past housing
policy](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/08959048231174882), and its
relationship to [online course
enrollments](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11162-018-9539-6). See
my [publications](https://www.btskinner.io/publications/) and [working
papers](https://www.btskinner.io/working/) pages for a complete list of my
papers (including open access versions) and my [GitHub
profile](https://github.com/btskinner) for links to replication files for many
of my projects.

I am the author and maintainer of a number of software packages,
including [rscorecard](https://www.btskinner.io/rscorecard/), which
can be used to download data from the [College
Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov);
[crosswalkr](https://www.btskinner.io/crosswalkr/), a port of a [set
of Stata commands](https://github.com/slhudson/rename-and-encode) that
help build primary data sets from smaller files in a reproducible
manner; [duawranglr](https://www.btskinner.io/duawranglr), a set of
functions to help users create shareable data sets from protected data
files according to a data use agreement; and [GitRoom
Manager](https://www.btskinner.io/grm/), a program that allows
instructors to more easily manage a GitHub-based virtual classroom
from the command line. Other small scripts that I share can be found
on my [code page](https://www.btskinner.io/code/).

I earned my doctorate in leadership and policy studies from Vanderbilt
University in 2017, master’s in the humanities from the University of
Chicago in 2008, and bachelor’s in music and English from Vanderbilt
in 2006.
