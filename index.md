I am a Research Assistant Professor of Education at the University of
Virginia with an affiliation in EdPolicyWorks. My research interests
center on the policies and practices that affect students who attend
community colleges and open access universities. In recent work I have
focused on the relationships between online course delivery and
student enrollments, course outcomes, and degree attainment. I am
also the author and maintainer of a number of software packages,
including rscorecard, an R package that can be used to download data
from the College Scorecard.
