I am an assistant professor of higher education and policy at
the University of Florida. I am also an affiliate of the Institute of
Higher Education at the University of Florida.

My research interests center on college access, the outcomes of
college participation, and using tools of data science such as machine
learning and Bayesian statistics to rigorously examine higher
education policy questions that are difficult to answer with
conventional econometric tools.

In my work I have examined how students weigh factors like [distance
and cost](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11162-018-9507-1)
when choosing a college and the effect of college participation on
both [economic
outcomes](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775715300303)
and
[civic](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00221546.2017.1291258)
[behaviors](https://www.muse.jhu.edu/article/796979). I have a
particular interest in students' access to broadband: how it varies
across student populations, its connection to past housing policy, and
its relationship to [online course
enrollments](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11162-018-9539-6). See
my [publications](https://www.btskinner.io/publications/) and [working
papers](https://www.btskinner.io/working/) pages for a complete list.

I am the author and maintainer of a number of software packages,
including [rscorecard](https://www.btskinner.io/rscorecard/), which
can be used to download data from the [College
Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov);
[crosswalkr](https://www.btskinner.io/crosswalkr/), a port of a [set
of Stata commands](https://github.com/slhudson/rename-and-encode) that
help build primary data sets from smaller files in a reproducible
manner; [duawranglr](https://www.btskinner.io/duawranglr), a set of
functions to help users create shareable data sets from protected data
files according to a data use agreement; and [GitRoom
Manager](https://www.btskinner.io/grm/), a program that allows
instructors to more easily manage a GitHub-based virtual classroom
from the command line. Other small scripts that I share can be found
[here](https://www.btskinner.io/code/).

I earned my doctorate in leadership and policy studies from Vanderbilt
University in 2017, master’s from the University of Chicago in
2008, and bachelor’s from Vanderbilt in 2006.
