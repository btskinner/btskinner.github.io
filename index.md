I am a Research Assistant Professor of Education and Public Policy at
the University of Virginia with affiliations in EdPolicyWorks, the
Nudge4 Solutions Lab, and the Batten School of Leadership and Public
Policy.

My research interests center on the policies and practices that affect
students who attend community colleges and broad access
universities. In my work I have focused on the relationships
between online course delivery and student enrollments, course
outcomes, and degree attainment; how students weigh factors
like distance and cost when choosing a college; and the economic and
social outcomes of college attendance. As part of
EdPolicyWorks and Nudge4, I have worked closely with numerous public
agencies and organizations including the Virginia Community College
System.

I am the author and maintainer of a number of software packages,
including [**rscorecard**](https://www.btskinner.me/rscorecard/), which
can be used to download data from the [College
Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov);
[**crosswalkr**](https://www.btskinner.me/crosswalkr/), a port of a [set
of Stata commands](https://github.com/slhudson/rename-and-encode) that
help build master data sets from smaller files in a reproducible
manner; [**duawranglr**](https://www.btskinner.me/duawranglr), a set of
functions to help users create shareable data sets from protected data files
according to a data use agreement; and [**GitRoom
Manager**](https://www.btskinner.me/grm/), a program that allows
instructors to more easily manage a GitHub-based virtual classroom
from the command line.

I earned my doctorate in leadership and policy studies from Vanderbilt
University in 2017, master’s from the University of Chicago in
2008, and bachelor’s from Vanderbilt in 2006.
