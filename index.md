I am a Research Assistant Professor of [Education in the Curry School
of Education at the University of
Virginia](https://curry.virginia.edu) with an affiliation in
[EdPolicyWorks](https://curry.virginia.edu/faculty-research/centers-labs-projects/edpolicyworks). My
research interests center on the policies and practices that affect
students who attend community colleges and open access
universities. In recent work I have focused on the relationships
between online course delivery and student enrollments, course
outcomes, and degree attainment.

I am the author and maintainer of a number of software packages,
including [rscorecard](https://www.btskinner.me/rscorecard/), which
can be used to download data from the [College
Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov),
[crosswalkr](https://www.btskinner.me/crosswalkr/), a port of a [set
of Stata commands](https://github.com/slhudson/rename-and-encode) that
help build master data sets from smaller files in a reproducible
manner, and [GitRoom Manager](https://www.btskinner.me/grm/), a
program that allows instructors to more easily manage a GitHub-based
virtual classroom from the command line.
